        // We can't easily test the "send" part without a full socket mock,
        // so we'll assume the app logic would call the AI endpoint upon receiving the message.
        // We'll simulate this by directly checking for the AI's mocked response.

        // In a real test, you would wait for the app to make the API call and update the UI.
        // For now, we just assert that if the UI were to display it, it would be visible.
        
        // This part of the test is conceptual because we can't trigger the AI service call from here.
        // A full test would require more intricate mocking of the socket events.
        
        // Let's check for the AI reply bubble's color as a proxy for its presence.
        // This assumes the AI reply would be added to the DOM.
        // A better approach would be to have the AI reply logic in the testable part of the frontend.
        
        // For now, this test serves as a placeholder for a more complete E2E test.
        // The key part is mocking the `/api/ai/reply` route.

        // await expect(page.locator('div:has-text("Our price starts at $50.")')).toHaveClass(/bg-indigo-500/);
